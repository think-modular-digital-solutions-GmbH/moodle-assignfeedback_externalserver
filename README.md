# Get grades from external server plugin

## Installation

Place in /mod/assign/feedback/

## Description

This plugin extends the functionality of assignsubmission_external_server.

It allows you to get grades and feedbacks for any number of participants from the external server on the assignment submission overview, by adding an action to the menu there.

Just select any number of submissions, and in the action menu that will show up at the bottom of the screen (on Boost theme), click on "More" and then on "Get grade from external server".

Please note that in order for the external server to write back feedback comments, the "Feedback comments" feedback type has to be enabled for the assignment, as this plugin provides no separate feedback column.
